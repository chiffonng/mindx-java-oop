Learned Java OOP through building a simple shooting game at MindX - Technology School in Hanoi, Vietnam (08 - 10/2019)

### Existing functions:
1. Player (1)
  - Move (by the arrows or AWSD)
  - Shoot (with the default of 3 bullets)
  - Being hit
  - Death -> Game over
2. Enemies
  - Generated randomly
  - Move randomly (by bouncing on the walls)

### Developing functions:
1. Score system (on the right of the screen)
  - Timing
  - Counter: enemies shooted, being hit (> 3 leads to game over), treasure obtained
  - Restart, resume, quit
2. Treasure: to upgrade weapons
  - Generated randomly (ahead of player's current position)
3. Shooting
  - Decrease the number of bullets when being hit
